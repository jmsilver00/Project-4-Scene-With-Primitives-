# Project-4-Scene-With-Primitives

How to run:

Ensure that the files roomscene.html, app.js, and gl-matrix.js are on your device in the same folder along with the attached jpegs. Then open roomscene.html in a WebGL friendly browser.

You may need to run it on WebStrorm due to chromes Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), if it's not disabled in your browser which prevents the textures from working correctly.
